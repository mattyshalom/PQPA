Story of Project Inspiration:

-> We observed the challenges faced by the student in information gathering, organizing, and effective learning structure  before, during even after there final exams, also in communication with there peres.
-> Itâ€™s also a futurist type of learning which also helps protect the environment by reduce the cutting down of trees to make books.
->This motivated us to develop a comprehensive solution that streamlines these processes and empowers the student and increases there focus.
